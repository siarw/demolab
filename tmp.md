Each project can receive up to â‚¬200,000 from the ESA Innovation Seed
Funds. The funds are distributed in phases: approximately 35% at the
start, 35% upon achieving progress milestones, and 30% after the
final deliverables are accepted. This structured funding helps
ensure that research teams have the necessary resources throughout
the project lifecycle. Additionally, any equipment purchased with
seed funding may be requested to be returned to NL PhiLab as part of
the final deliverables. This approach ensures efficient use of
resources and supports the ongoing research efforts within NL
PhiLab.
