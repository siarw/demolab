        Call for Projects
      </h2>

      <h3 class="mb-4 text-3xl font-bold text-dark-blue-900">Overview</h3>
      <p class="mb-8 text-base text-gray-700">
        The purpose of this Call for Projects at NL PhiLab is to inform you
        about the opportunity to apply with research projects to be supported by
        NL PhiLab and to provide you with materials and guidance needed to
        apply. The Call is permanently open, but evaluation of applications is
        scheduled periodically. Dates will be posted on our NL PhiLab website.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mb-4 text-3xl font-bold text-dark-blue-900">
        Research Themes
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-8 text-base text-gray-700">
        We invite you to submit research project ideas in the areas of Earth
        Observation, Position, Navigation and Timing, and Laser Satellite
        Communication. Your project should be relevant for one of these themes.
        In addition to these, we will support any demonstrably good project on
        other space-related areas.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-8 text-base text-gray-700">
        Proposed activities should have a commercial market potential. To
        support their ideas, the applicant can identify knowledgeable entities
        among our partners (see NL PhiLab website).
      </p>

      <h3 class="mb-4 text-3xl font-bold text-dark-blue-900">
        Eligibility and Suitability
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-8 text-base text-gray-700">
        The project proposal must be submitted by (a team part of) a legal
        entity or a consortium of legal entities.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-8 text-base text-gray-700">
        The idea must have a valid space connection. For NL PhiLab, the focus
        will be on the exploitation of space technology, use of knowledge from
        the space domain, or utilisation of space systems and space-based
        services in non-space domains (spin-off).
      </p>

      <p class="mb-8 text-base text-gray-700">
        The proposed idea should be based on solid research-driven evidence,
        should be disruptive, and should have high potential for socio-economic
        impact. Your team should be able to show evidence that the project will
        deliver a technological game-changer or address a pressing need that
        would facilitate the future market adoption.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-8 text-base text-gray-700">
        We will also consider strong proposals for products or services for the
        space sector, addressing any part of the space value chain (from
        components to entirely new space systems or related facilities and
        services) and any related activity (from concept definition to
        operation), possibly using non-space technology (spin-in).
      </p>
      <p class="mb-8 text-base text-gray-700">
        We encourage you to submit an
        <a href="idea-outline.html" class="underline hover:text-orange-500"
          >Idea Outline</a
        >
        to get more assistance in preparing your proposal.
